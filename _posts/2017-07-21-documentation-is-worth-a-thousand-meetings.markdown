A picture is worth a thousand words.

Well if there is any truth to that then the documentation you write is worth at LEAST a thousand meetings. I mean we have all been in those meetings haven't we? The ones where the person holding the meeting have a question that needs to be answered. They invited the ONE person who knows the answer. But oh that person hates documenting stuff and is notorious for telling you to go figure it out yourself. So 4-5 other people get invited because they may know something about it. And you have the meeting but oh wait something was going on that day so half the meeting was to talk about something else entirely because we were all together anyhow and it felt important. So just when you get rolling its time and everybody seems to have a hard stop. So you schedule another one and then people can't attend or don't see why you need the meeting. So you direct message them and they don't respond. And you want to DM them again but that would be too pestering wouldn't it?

And now you have a whole freakin circus just to answer questions on how things are setup when one person could have done it in 1/15th the time if they just wrote up a little thing when they first built it.

Take this for example:<br>
![Random Documentation]({{ site.url }}/downloads/random_setup.png){:width="600"}

This is by no means a detailed piece of documentation. This took like 3 meetings with no less than 3 people in each meeting to get detailed out and drawn up.

Is that excessive? <br>Hell yes. <br>Is that common in lots of places? <br>Oh hell yes it is and it makes me want to cry.

This all could have been avoided by documenting what you build WHEN you are building it.

So please for the love of the deity or belief system you have. Document what you are doing.
