I recently picked up golang for fun. I've heard great things and Twitter won't shut up about it. If it garners mention from [@ashleymcnamara](https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara/status/898106432557506561) then I am on board for checking it out.

I come from a background of Perl and Python. So this has been a fun experience on how the other half of the (statically typed/compiled) world lives. And with Go it is much easier than I was expecting!

Short list of things I've absolutely adored (keeping in mind I'm a newbie here):
1. Compiles to assembly. Very transportable and, so far, seems easily supported by many operating systems.
2. Syntax of code is close to dynamically typed languages (inferring types ftw).
3. Workspace structuring for code makes it easily managed by version control.
4. Coding Go in the Visual Studio Code IDE. It is my first time using this IDE and it is fantastic with Go.

Things that have been a bit of a headache:
1. Finding equivalents to pyenv and virtualenv and getting them working.
2. Finding good books for my junior-ish level of programming experience. So far things seem to be aimed at a lot of C++/Java developers with more experience.
3. Dealing with odd indentation patterns from different people. For better or worse Python forced consistency on you.

All in all it has been a good couple weeks with Go. Here's a few links that I have saved and am looking through on the daily to help me absorb more of the language:
